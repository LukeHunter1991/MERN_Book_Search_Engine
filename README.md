## Description

In this program I built on top of starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Once a user has created an account or logged in they can search for books using the Google Books API. They can then save books to their own favourites page and delete books from their favourites. I did this to gain a deeper understanding of GraphQL and Apollo.
